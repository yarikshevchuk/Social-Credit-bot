# Social-Credit-system

This is the code for social credit system for telegram.
It counts the chat members' rating with a help of a special stickerpack (the link can be received with the /help command)
Users update the other users' ratings. There's a limit of how much rating you can change every day.

The system adjusts your rating to your environment's average rating. 
The environment is all the users from all the chats you share.

Some gifts are granted for achieving a certain score.
